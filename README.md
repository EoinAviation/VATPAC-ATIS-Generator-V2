# VATPAC-ATIS-Generator-V2
The old VATPAC ATIS generator converted into an ElectronJS Desktop client.

To get started, run 'npm i', to install the node modules, then run 'npm start' to start the application.

There are no build instructions as of now.
This also now runs a local HTTP server which EuroScope can use to get the text ATIS.
This server is used for sending METAR data to the application as well as returning the text ATIS.
