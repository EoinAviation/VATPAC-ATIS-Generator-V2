# VATPAC-ATIS-Generator-V2
The old VATPAC ATIS generator converted into an ElectronJS Desktop client.

To get started, run `npm i`, to install the node modules, then run 'npm start' to start the application. Or you can simply run the provided `start.bat` script.

To build into an executable, run `npm build-windows`. Or you can simply run the provided `build.bat` script.

The generator works by running a local HTTP server which is used to communicate between EuroScope and the application.

Airport definitions can be added in `Data/airports.json`.
